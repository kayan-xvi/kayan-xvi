### Hello 
My profile is pretty empty due to only joining recently but I've been coding for 2 years
I previously did VEX Robotics so had some, but limied, interaction with code 
(And no, I haven't just made this for Atlas, though I have populated it for you - I've been using it for JS resources)

Languages: 
- Python - intermediate 
- C - intermediate 
- JavaScript - Beginner (currently experimenting with tools: Node.js, pixi.js) 

Projects I have worked on: 
- Wordle bot 
- Poker (heads-up NLHE) bot  
  - Determining the number of each possible hand 
  -  Computer to play against you using logic 
  -  Working environment to play in including betting (still in progress) 
- Experimenting (struggling) with pixi.js in the attempt to make a 2D viewable asset 

Starting September 2022: 
- I will be using React Native (JS) 

I want to learn more about:
