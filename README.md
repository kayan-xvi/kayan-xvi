### Hello 
My profile is pretty empty due to only joining recently but I've been coding for 3 years
I previously did VEX Robotics so had some, but limied, interaction with code. 
I only update my profile when I finish a project or need to push to here so I can access it from another machine. 

Languages: 
- Python - intermediate 
- C - intermediate 
- JavaScript - Beginner (currently experimenting with tools: Node.js, pixi.js) 

Projects I have worked on: 
- An obsidian plugin for myself to interact with the GPT API
- Tic Tac Toe decision tree bot to test the validity of a new version I've seen proposed 
- Wordle bot 
- Poker (heads-up NLHE) bot  
  - Determining the number of each possible hand 
  - Computer to play against you using logic 
  - Working environment to play in including betting (still in progress) 
- Experimenting (struggling) with pixi.js in the attempt to make a 2D viewable asset 

I want to learn more about: 
- ANNs 
- ML 
- Numpy
